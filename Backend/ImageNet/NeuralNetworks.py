class Image2Caption(nn.Module):
    """Our Image captioning model starts by creating feature maps using the pretrained vgg16 layers
    and word embeddings using the default embedding layer. The vgg16 model takes as input rgb
    images while the embedding layer takes as input word captions pre-mapped to unique indices.
    The feature maps serve as the input queries to the 2d local attention model while the
    captions concatenated to the attention layer outputs serve as the inputs to the rnn layer.
    The context vectors for the 2d local attention model are the hidden states of the rnn
    layer where the first context vector is the zero vector. The significance of using the zero
    vector as the first context is that the attention mechanism treats every query within the window
    equally - effectively taking the mean. The rnn hidden states are also fed into a linear layer
    that decodes the hidden states into word captions in the vocabulary. Lastly, in order to prevent
    overfitting drop out is implemented after the embedding and rnn stages.

    Args:
        learning_rate (float): the rate used to update the gradient.
        channel_size (int): the size of the feature maps.
        momentum (float): the momentum for batch normalization
        vocab_size (int): the size of the vocabulary.
        embed_size (int): the embeding size to use for a word caption.
        drop (float): the drop out rate.
        hidden_size (int): the output size of the rnn layer.
        window (int): the window used for the 2d local attention model.
        max_len (int): the maximum length of an inferred caption.
        beam_size (int): the number of paths to check during the beam search.

    Inputs: images, captions, lengths
        - **images** of shape (batch,img_channels,x_dim,y_dim): tensor containing all
        of the images in the current batch.
        - **captions** of shape (batch,cap_size): long tensor containing the captions for
        the current batch. The captions are padded with 1's (end word) if they are smaller than
        the longest caption in the current batch (cap_size).
        - **lengths** of shape (batch): long tensor containing the number of words in each caption
        for the current batch.

    Outputs: words
        - **words** of shape (batch,cap_size,vocab_size): tensor containing the one-hot encoded
        captions predicted by the model.

    Attributes: image_encoder, embedding, dropout, attention, rnn, decoder, decoder_dropout
        - **image_encoder** with parameters (channel_size, momentum): the feature maps extracted
        from the image data using the pretrained vgg16 model.
        - **embedding** with parameters (vocab_size,embed_size): the embedding layer mapping indices
        to embeddings.
        - **dropout** with parameter (drop): the dropout layer for the captions to prevent
        overfitting.
        - **attention** with parameters (channel_size, hidden_size, window): the 2d local attention
        used to attend on a portion of an image and weigh the importance of each subregion.
        - **rnn** with parameters (channel_size+embed_size,hidden_size): the recurrent layer used to
        learn sequential information obtained from the network.
        - **decoder** with parameters (hidden_size,vocab_size): the linear layer used to decode the
        captions from the rnn output.
        - **decoder_dropout** with parameter (drop): the dropout layer for the rnn outputs used to
        prevent overfitting.
