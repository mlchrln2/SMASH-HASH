Smash-Hash: Image Recommendation Network
================================================
A two part neural network that first captions an image and then uses the caption embeddings to recommend similar images on a graph. This project is still in development and needs minor improvements to the captioning network and a reformulation of the Graphical Convolution Network.

Dependencies:
------------
* [torch - 1.1.0](https://pytorch.org/)
* [torchvision - 0.3.0](https://pytorch.org/)
* [tensorboardX - 1.7](https://pypi.org/project/tensorboardX/)
* [nltk - 3.4.1](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/)
* [h5py - 2.9.0](https://pypi.org/project/h5py/)
* [PIL - 6.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
* [pycocotools - 2.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/pycocotools/)

ImageNet: Image Captioning Network
================================================
The captioning network first encodes the image using the VGG16 pretrained network and then applies a 2D Attention layer over the encoded image. The 2D Attention layer invented for the purposes of this project is an adapted form of [Luong self-attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025.pdf). The 2D Attention layer extends the reach of Luong self-attention to problems in computer vision and instead introduces an image centroid with a gaussian window around that centroid. To see the results of the model or to setup the environment for development purposes move into the Backend/ImageNet directory and follow the instruction below.
