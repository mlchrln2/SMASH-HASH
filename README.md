Smash-Hash: Image Recommendation Network
================================================
A two part network that first captions an image and then uses the caption embedding to recommend similar images on a graph. This project is still in development and needs minor improvements to the captioning network and reformulation of the Graphical Convolution Network.

Dependencies:
------------
* torch
* torchvision
* tensorboardX
* nltk
* h5py
* PIL
* gc

ImageNet: Image Captioning Network
================================================

Data Preparation (for development):
------------
```bash
# To create data files for faster training and validation:
python3 DataWriter.py
```

Parameter Setup (for development):
------------
``` bash
# Edit this file to toggle hyperparameters:
python3 HyperParameters.py
```

Training Setup (for development):
------------
```bash
# To train a new model:
python3 ImageTrain.py

# To continue training an old model:
python3 ImageTrain.py /path/to/file
```

Model Validation (for development):
------------
```bash
# To check the effectiveness of the model with the greedy search algorithm:
python3 ImageVal.py /path/to/file greedy

# To check the effectiveness of the model with the beam search algorithm:
python3 ImageVal.py /path/to/file beam
```
Demonstrations:
------------
```bash
# Check the jupyter notebook for some intermediate results:
jupyter notebook ImageNetDemo.ipynb
```
